Mental Health Tracker

The Mental Health Tracker is a tool designed to help individuals track and improve their mental health. The tool utilizes a series of questions to gather information about the individual's emotional state, stress levels, sleep patterns, and other factors relevant to mental health.

Based on the individual's responses, the tool suggests personalized tasks aimed at improving their mental health. These tasks may include mindfulness practices, physical exercise, seeking professional help, spending time with loved ones, or pursuing hobbies and interests that can improve mood and overall well-being.

One of the most important features of the tool is the ability to maintain a record of the individual's mental state over time. This record can be displayed on a dashboard, allowing individuals to track their progress and identify patterns in their mental health. This information can then be used to make proactive adjustments to lifestyle, seek professional help, or make other changes as needed.
